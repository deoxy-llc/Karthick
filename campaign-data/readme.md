For "clicks", sometimes multiple URLs are associated with the same email. In that case, add up the click numbers and report a total. The following is an example:

    EMAIL URL 1MinColumn-Clicks

    ljh216@psu.edu	https://inventbiotech.com/pages/contact-us	5

    ljh216@psu.edu	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8BlE1Kwuec	4

    ljh216@psu.edu	https://inventbiotech.com/collections/fast-protein-extraction-1	3

    ljh216@psu.edu	https://inventbiotech.com/collections/fast-protein-extraction-1/products/minute-total-protein-extraction-kit-for-animal-cultured-cells-and-tissues-us-patent-9-580-462	3

For the above example, report "15" (which is the sum of 5,4,3,3) for value "1MinColumn-Clicks".
